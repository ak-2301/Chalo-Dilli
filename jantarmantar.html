            <h3>About Jantar Mantar </h3>
            <hr style="font-weight: 100px; font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">
            <br>
            <p class="card-text">Jantar Mantar is an astronomical observatory situated in the heart of the capital city
                of India – Delhi. This is a phenomenal marvel of architectural brilliance whose shape represents a big
                sundial. Since its construction, this observatory has seemingly contributed to the study of both time
                and space. Maharaja Jai Singh laid the foundation stone for constructing this magnificent structure in
                the year 1724. Likewise, today, we have four more observatories situated in the cities of Varanasi,
                Jaipur, Mathura, and Ujjain.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The primary aim underlying the construction of this massive observatory was the preparation of
                astronomical charts. These were then used to track the local time zones by keeping an eye on the
                movement and transitions of the sun, the moon and the different planets that constitute our solar
                system. It thus follows that a highly precious observatory of the ancient past never fails to surprise
                the technology-influenced astronomers and researchers. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Delhi’s Jantar Mantar has a got a whopping height of around 723 feet and is comprised of different
                astronomical instruments totalling to a count of 13 units. Amongst these, the most precious and widely
                acknowledged ones are – Samrat Yantra, Misra Yantra, Ram Yantra, and Jai Prakash Yantra. The sundial,
                which forms the chief attraction here, is highly influenced by the ancient Egyptian Ptolemaic Structure.
                It strictly adheres to the sequential celestial orders of the local arrangement of the equatorial,
                ecliptic, and the horizontal-zenith planes.
